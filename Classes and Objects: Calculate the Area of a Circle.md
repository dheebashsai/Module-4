# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
      import math
      
      # Step 2: Define the class
      class cse:
          # Step 3: Define the method to calculate area
          def mech(self, radius):
              area = math.pi * radius * radius
              print("Area of the circle is:", area)
      
      # Step 1: Get user input
      r = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
      
      # Step 4: Create object and call method
      obj = cse()
      obj.mech(r)

## Output
Enter the radius of the circle: 5
Area of the circle is: 78.53981633974483


## Result
The program successfully calculates and displays the area of a circle using a class and method.
